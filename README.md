# Goldfinch E-bikes: A case study of E-bike usage in New York City
## Bringing E-bikes to Des Moines

Recently, a friend and I spent two weeks in New York City. We were able to get an intimate view of the city because we chose Citibike's E-bikes as our primary form of transportation. We enjoyed the experience so much that we are contemplating creating an E-bike service in our hometown of Des Moines, IA. 
I've been approached by an angel incvestor who is interested in the project.

To gain the investor's confidence we prepared a proposal using Tableau. Using colorful charts and providing details in a understandable manner that is just long enough to keep the investor's attention.
